# TypeScript Tutorial

Welcome to this comprehensive TypeScript tutorial! This project is designed to guide you through the core concepts of TypeScript, from basic setup to advanced features.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   cd typescript-tutorial-main
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
